A tumor lesion from the patient biopsied before or during screening shows either: Overexpression of the HER2 protein, as determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC, with result IHC 3+) or Amplification of the HER2 gene as determined by FISH (at least 4 fold i.e. at least 8 copies). Note: Overexpression/amplification measurements must be performed on a metastatic lesion in all cases where such a lesion is sufficiently easily accessible. If however such a biopsy is not possible, then these measurements can be performed on the primary tumor. Use of the primary tumor is to be documented and justified. Ten FFPE tissue sections of the tumor on which the HER2 overexpression/amplification has been done -if available-may be requested. These may be used to retrospectively carry out part of the translational research (i.e. analysis of EGF receptor activity and of the presence of immune effector cells, refer to Section 7). The patient has at least one measurable lesion according to RECIST criteria. The patient has ECOG status of 0 or 1. The patient has adequate bone marrow reserve as indicated by: White blood cell count >/= 3,000/mm3. Neutrophil count >/= 1,500/mm3. Platelet count >/= 100,000/mm3. Hemoglobin levels >/= 10.0 g/dl. The patient has adequate renal function as shown by the creatinine levels (i.e. within the normal range). The patient has adequate hepatic function as shown by serum bilirubin levels i.e: Serum bilirubin levels within the normal limits. Both AST and ALT levels <1.5 times the ULN. Note: However, for patients with liver metastasis, a serum bilirubin level <1.5 times the ULN and both AST and ALT levels <3 times the ULN will be accepted. The patient has a baseline Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) measured by MUGA scan equal to or greater than the LLN for the radiology facility. If the patient is female, she must be of non-childbearing potential, i.e. have a current tubal ligation, hysterectomy, ovariectomy or be post-menopausal, or if she is of childbearing potential, she must practice adequate contraception for 30 days prior to treatment, have a negative pregnancy test and continue such precautions for two months after completion of the study treatment. Adequate contraception is defined as a contraceptive method with failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly (when applicable, as mentioned in the product label) for example abstinence, combined or progestogen oral contraceptives, injectable progestogen, implants of levonorgestrel, oestrogenic vaginal ring, percutaneous contraceptive patches or intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS), vasectomy with documented azoospermia of the sole male partner or double barrier method (condom or occlusive cap plus spermicidal agent). For azoospermia, \"documented\" refers to the outcome of the investigator's/ designee's medical examination of the subject or review of the subject's medical history for study eligibility, as obtained via a verbal interview with the subject or from the subject's medical records. Post-menopause: Menopause is the age associated with complete cessation of menstrual cycles, menses, and implies the loss of reproductive potential by ovarian failure. A practical definition accepts menopause after 1 year without menses with an appropriate clinical profile at the appropriate age e.g. > 45 years. Able to swallow and retain oral medication. In the view of the investigator, the patient can and will comply with the requirements of the protocol. Exclusion Criteria: The following criteria should be checked at the time of study entry. If any apply, the patient must not be included in the study: The patient has received > 300 mg/m2 doxorubicin (cumulative dose) or > 600 mg/m2 epirubicin (cumulative dose). The patient is receiving treatment with bisphosphonate UNLESS the biphosphonate treatment was initiated more than three weeks before the first ASCI administration. (See also section 5.3.2.). The patient has received any investigational or non-registered product (drug or vaccine) other than the study treatment(s) within 30 days preceding the first dose of study treatment, or planned use during the study period. The patient is currently receiving amiodarone or has received amiodarone in the 6 months prior to screening. The patient requires concomitant treatment with systemic corticosteroids or any immunosuppressive agents. The use of prednisone, or equivalent, <0.5 mg/kg/day (absolute maximum 40 mg/day), or inhaled corticosteroids or topical steroids is permitted. The patient has a malabsorption syndrome, disease significantly affecting gastrointestinal function, or resection of the stomach or small bowel. Patients with ulcerative colitis. The patient has known coronary artery disease, arrhythmia requiring treatment, clinically significant valvular disease, cardiomegaly on chest X-ray, ventricular hypertrophy (found by ECG) or previous myocardial infarction. The patient has any acute or chronic, clinically significant pulmonary, cardiovascular, hepatic or renal functional abnormality, as determined by physical examination or laboratory screening tests. The patient has current active hepatic or biliary's disease (with exception of patients with Gilbert's syndrome, asymptomatic gallstones, liver metastases or stable chronic liver disease per investigator assessment). The patient presents with autoimmune disease (vitiligo and autoimmune thyroid disease is not an exclusion criterion). The patient has a known family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency. The patient has any uncontrolled bleeding disorder or coagulation disorder or thrombocytopenia or pro-thrombotic disorder. The patient has a history of anaphylaxis or severe allergic reaction to vaccines or unknown allergens. The patient has a known immediate or delayed hypersensitivity reaction or idiosyncrasy to drugs chemically related to Lapatinib. These include other anilinoquinazolines, such as gefitinib (Iressa), erlotinib (Tarceva), or other chemically related compounds or excipients. The patient is known to be positive for the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). The patient has (or has had) previous or concomitant malignancies at other sites except effectively treated: Non-melanoma skin cancers or carcinoma in situ of the cervix Malignancy that has been in remission for > 2 years and is considered highly likely to have been cured. The patient has any psychiatric or addictive disorder that may compromise her ability to give informed consent, or to comply with the trial procedures. The patient has any other condition that in the opinion of the investigator might jeopardize the patient's safety or ability to comply with the requirements of the study. The patient is pregnant or lactating.\nStatement: Candidates for the primary trial must have adequate colon and liver function, and must not be currently receiving amiodarone or have received amiodarone in the last 28 day.

Written informed consent has been obtained from the patient prior to the performance of any protocol-specific procedure. The patient is diagnosed with confirmed invasive breast cancer with stage IV disease. Note: If the metastatic disease is restricted to a solitary lesion, its neoplastic nature should be confirmed by cytology or histology. The patient has documented disease progression or relapse following at least one prior standard therapy with trastuzumab (alone or in combination with chemotherapy). Patients with prior lapatinib use are eligible. Furthermore, The administration of the chemotherapeutic agent(s) should have been stopped for at least 28 days by the time of the first ASCI administration. The administration of trastuzumab alone could be maintained after chemotherapy, but the last dose of trastuzumab should not have been given less than three weeks before the first ASCI administration. The patient will not be given trastuzumab during the trial. For metastatic patients whose disease is ER+ and/or PR+ the following criteria should be met: Patients with visceral disease that requires chemotherapy (eg., patients with liver or lung metastases). Rapidly progressing or life threatening disease, as determined by the investigator. Patients who received hormonal therapy and are no longer benefiting from this therapy. A tumor lesion from the patient biopsied before or during screening shows either: Overexpression of the HER2 protein, as determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC, with result IHC 3+) or Amplification of the HER2 gene as determined by FISH (at least 4 fold i.e. at least 8 copies). Note: Overexpression/amplification measurements must be performed on a metastatic lesion in all cases where such a lesion is sufficiently easily accessible. If however such a biopsy is not possible, then these measurements can be performed on the primary tumor. Use of the primary tumor is to be documented and justified. Ten FFPE tissue sections of the tumor on which the HER2 overexpression/amplification has been done -if available-may be requested. These may be used to retrospectively carry out part of the translational research (i.e. analysis of EGF receptor activity and of the presence of immune effector cells, refer to Section 7).

The patient has adequate renal function as shown by the creatinine levels (i.e. within the normal range). The patient has adequate hepatic function as shown by serum bilirubin levels i.e: Serum bilirubin levels within the normal limits. Both AST and ALT levels <1.5 times the ULN. Note: However, for patients with liver metastasis, a serum bilirubin level <1.5 times the ULN and both AST and ALT levels <3 times the ULN will be accepted. The patient has a baseline Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) measured by MUGA scan equal to or greater than the LLN for the radiology facility.

Adequate contraception is defined as a contraceptive method with failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly (when applicable, as mentioned in the product label) for example abstinence, combined or progestogen oral contraceptives, injectable progestogen, implants of levonorgestrel, oestrogenic vaginal ring, percutaneous contraceptive patches or intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS), vasectomy with documented azoospermia of the sole male partner or double barrier method (condom or occlusive cap plus spermicidal agent). For azoospermia, \"documented\" refers to the outcome of the investigator's/ designee's medical examination of the subject or review of the subject's medical history for study eligibility, as obtained via a verbal interview with the subject or from the subject's medical records. Post-menopause: Menopause is the age associated with complete cessation of menstrual cycles, menses, and implies the loss of reproductive potential by ovarian failure. A practical definition accepts menopause after 1 year without menses with an appropriate clinical profile at the appropriate age e.g. > 45 years. Able to swallow and retain oral medication.

Patients must have the ability to swallow oral medication. The patient's Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status must be 0 or 1. At the time of study entry, blood counts must meet the following criteria: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) must be greater than/equal to 1200/mm3. Platelet count must be greater than/equal to 100,000/mm^3. Hemoglobin must be greater than/equal to 10 g/dL. The following criteria for evidence of adequate hepatic function must be met: total bilirubin must be less than/equal to upper limit of normal (ULN) for the lab unless the patient has a grade 1 bilirubin elevation (greater than ULN to 1.5 x ULN) due to Gilbert's disease or similar syndrome involving slow conjugation of bilirubin; and alkaline phosphatase must be less than 2.5 x ULN for the lab; and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) must be less than/equal to 1.5 x ULN for the lab. Alkaline phosphatase and AST may not both be greater than the ULN. For example, if the alkaline phosphatase is greater than the ULN but less than/equal to 2.5 x ULN, then the AST must be less than/equal to the ULN. If the AST is greater than the ULN but less than/equal to 1.5 x ULN, then the alkaline phosphatase must be less than/equal to ULN. Patients with either skeletal pain or alkaline phosphatase that is greater than ULN but less than/equal to 2.5 x ULN are eligible for inclusion in the study if a bone scan or positron emission tomography (PET) scan does not demonstrate metastatic disease. Patients with suspicious findings on bone scan or PET scan are eligible if suspicious findings are confirmed as benign by x-ray, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or biopsy. Patients with AST or alkaline phosphatase greater than ULN are eligible for inclusion in the study if liver imaging (computed tomography [CT], MRI, or PET scan) does not demonstrate metastatic disease and adequate hepatic function.

Note: If the cardiac imaging facility cannot provide a LLN, use 50% as the LLN value. Note: Since the pre-entry LVEF serves as the baseline for comparing subsequent LVEF assessments to determine if bevacizumab therapy can be continued following doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC) and postoperatively, it is critical that this baseline study be an accurate assessment of the patient's LVEF.

Prior history of breast cancer, including DCIS (patients with a history of LCIS are eligible). Treatment, including radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and/or hormonal therapy administered for the currently diagnosed breast cancer prior to randomization. One exception is hormonal therapy, which may have been given for up to a total of 28 days anytime after diagnosis and before study entry. In such a case, hormonal therapy must stop at or before randomization and be re-started, if indicated, following chemotherapy. A second exception is radiation therapy for patients enrolled in NSABP B-39 and assigned to partial breast irradiation (Group 2). These patients may have received RT prior to B-38 study entry. Prior therapy with anthracyclines or taxanes for any malignancy. Any sex hormonal therapy, e.g., birth control pills, ovarian hormonal replacement therapy, etc. (These patients are eligible if this therapy is discontinued prior to randomization.) Therapy with any hormonal agents such as raloxifene (Evista\u00ae), tamoxifen, or other selective estrogen-receptor modulators (SERMs), either for osteoporosis or breast cancer prevention. (Patients are eligible only if these medications are discontinued prior to randomization. Cardiac disease that would preclude the use of anthracyclines. This includes: history of myocardial infarction documented by elevated cardiac enzymes or regional wall abnormalities on assessment of left ventricular (LV) function; angina pectoris that requires the use of anti-anginal medication; any history of documented congestive heart failure; serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication; severe conduction abnormality; valvular disease with documented cardiac function compromise; and uncontrolled hypertension defined as blood pressure greater than 160/100 on antihypertensive therapy. Conditions that would prohibit administration of corticosteroids. Sensory/motor neuropathy greater than or equal to grade 2, as defined by the NCI's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 3.0. Non-malignant systemic disease (cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, etc.) that would preclude a patient from receiving any of the treatment options or would prevent prolonged follow-up. History of hepatitis B or C. Pregnancy or lactation at the time of proposed randomization. Women of reproductive potential must agree to use an effective non-hormonal method of contraception. Concurrent treatment with other investigational agents for the treatment of breast cancer. Psychiatric or addictive disorders or other conditions that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude the patient from meeting the study requirements. Special conditions for ineligibility of lumpectomy patients: radiation therapy and surgery For patients treated by lumpectomy, whole breast irradiation is required. The following patients will be ineligible: Patients with diffuse tumors (as demonstrated on mammography) treated with lumpectomy. (These patients are eligible if they undergo mastectomy.) Patients treated with lumpectomy in whom there is another clinically dominant mass or mammographically suspicious abnormality within the ipsilateral breast remnant. Such a mass must be biopsied and demonstrated to be histologically benign prior to randomization or, if malignant, must be surgically removed with clear margins.

If any sentinel node is histologically positive by H & E, or histologically suspicious on H & E and confirmed positive by immunohistochemistry (IHC), then the patient must have a completion axillary dissection. The tumor must be invasive adenocarcinoma on histologic examination with clinical assessment T1-3, N0-1, M0. Patients must not be participating in any other clinical trials of systemic therapy for early-stage breast cancer. Patients may participate in the following radiation therapy trials: Node-positive patients may participate in the National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group protocol MA.20, provided the requirements of the B-34 protocol continue to be met. (Node-negative B-34 patients may not participate in MA.20.) Node-positive mastectomy patients may participate in Southwest Oncology Group protocol S9927, provided the requirements of the B-34 protocol continue to be met. Patients must have an analysis of both estrogen and progesterone receptors on the primary tumor performed prior to randomization. Tumors will be defined as ER or progesterone receptor (PgR) positive if: 1) the Dextran-coated charcoal or sucrose-density gradient method shows them to have greater than or equal to 10 fmol/mg cytosol protein, or 2) if using individual laboratory criteria they can be shown to be positive by the enzyme immunoassay method (EIA) or immunocytochemical assay. \"Marginal or borderline,\" results (i.e., those not definitively negative) will also be considered positive. At the time of randomization, the patient must have had the following within the past 3 months: history and physical exam, a bone scan, thoracic and lumbar spine x-rays, and a chest x-ray. Within the past 12 months patients must have had a gynecologic exam (for women who have a uterus and who will be taking tamoxifen) and a bilateral mammogram. At the time of randomization: the postoperative absolute neutrophil count (ANC) must be greater than or equal to 1500/mm3 (or less than 1500/mm3 if, in the opinion of the investigator, this represents an ethnic or racial variation of normal); the postoperative platelet count must be greater than or equal to 100,000; there must be postoperative evidence of adequate hepatic function, i.e., total bilirubin at or below the upper limit of normal (ULN) for the laboratory; and alkaline phosphatase less than 2.5 x the ULN; and the serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (SGOT)/ aspartate transaminase (AST) less than 1.5 x the ULN; there must be postoperative evidence of adequate renal function (serum creatinine within or less than the laboratory's normal range). Serum albumin and serum calcium must be within normal limits. A patient with skeletal pain is eligible for inclusion in the study if bone scan and/or roentgenological examination fails to disclose metastatic disease. Suspicious findings must be confirmed as benign by x-ray, MRI, or biopsy. Patients with prior nonbreast malignancies are eligible if they have been disease- free for greater than or equal to 5 years before randomization and are deemed at low risk for recurrence by their treating physicians. Patients with squamous or basal cell carcinoma of the skin that has been effectively treated, carcinoma in situ of the cervix that has been treated by surgery only, or lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) of the ipsilateral or contralateral breast treated by hormone therapy and/or surgery only are eligible, even if these were diagnosed within 5 years before randomization. Patients must have a Zubrod performance status of 0, 1, or 2. Special conditions for eligibility of lumpectomy patients: Irradiation and surgery. Patients treated by lumpectomy and axillary node dissection (or no axillary dissection if sentinel node biopsy is negative) to be followed by breast radiation therapy must meet all the eligibility criteria in addition to the following: Generally, lumpectomy should be reserved for tumors less than 5 cm. However, at the investigator's discretion, patients treated with lumpectomy for tumors greater than or equal to 5 cm are eligible. The margins of the resected specimen must be histologically free of invasive tumor and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). For patients in whom pathologic examination demonstrates tumor present at the line of resection, additional operative procedures may be performed to obtain clear margins. This is permissible even if axillary dissection has been performed. Patients in whom tumor is still present at the resected margins after re-excision(s) must undergo total mastectomy to be eligible. Ineligibility. Significant non-malignant bone disease that is likely to interfere with the interpretation of bone x-rays. Ulceration, erythema, infiltration of the skin or the underlying chest wall (complete fixation), peau d'orange, or skin edema of any magnitude. (Tethering or dimpling of the skin or nipple inversion should not be interpreted as skin infiltration. Patients with these conditions are eligible.) Ipsilateral lymph nodes that on clinical examination are found to be fixed to one another or to other structures (cN2 disease). Suspicious palpable nodes in the contralateral axilla or palpable supraclavicular or infraclavicular nodes, unless there is biopsy evidence that these are not involved with tumor. Prior therapy for breast cancer, including irradiation, chemotherapy, biotherapy, and/or hormonal therapy, with the exception of tamoxifen. Tamoxifen may be given as adjuvant therapy before study entry, but only if it was started within 28 days before randomization. Patients who started tamoxifen within 28 days before randomization and who are being considered for chemotherapy must have their tamoxifen stopped at the start of chemotherapy. Prior history of breast cancer, except LCIS. Any sex hormonal therapy, e.g., birth control pills, ovarian hormonal replacement therapy, etc. (These patients are eligible only if this therapy is discontinued prior to randomization.) Exceptions: patients may use low-dose estrogen vaginal creams or Estring\u00ae for symptomatic vaginal dryness, raloxifene (or other selective estrogen receptor modulators [SERMs]) for the prevention of osteoporosis, and luteinizing-hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists/antagonists for the purpose of medical ovarian ablation as a component of adjuvant therapy for the breast cancer. Patients currently taking alendronate (Fosamax\u00ae) or other bisphosphonates or calcitonin to treat or prevent osteoporosis are not eligible. Non-malignant systemic disease (cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, etc.) that would preclude a patient from being subjected to any of the treatment options or would prevent prolonged follow-up. Psychiatric or addictive disorders that would preclude obtaining informed consent. Pregnancy or lactation at the time of proposed randomization. This protocol excludes pregnant or lactating women because the effects of clodronate on such women have not been studied fully. Bilateral malignancy or a mass or mammographic abnormality in the opposite breast suspicious for malignancy unless there is biopsy proof that the mass is not malignant. Special conditions for ineligibility of lumpectomy patients: Irradiation and surgery. The following patients will also be ineligible: Patients with diffuse tumors (as demonstrated on mammography) that would not be considered surgically amenable to lumpectomy. Patients treated with lumpectomy in whom there is another clinically dominant mass or mammographically suspicious abnormality within the ipsilateral breast remnant. Such a mass must be biopsied and demonstrated to be histologically benign prior to randomization or, if malignant, must be surgically removed with clear margins. Patients in whom the margins of the resected specimen are involved with invasive tumor or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Additional surgical resections to obtain free margins are allowed.

Patients must have clinical Stage IIIA, IIIB, or IIIC disease with a mass in the breast or axilla that is greater than or equal to 2.0 cm measured by clinical exam, unless the patient has inflammatory breast carcinoma, in which case measurable disease is not required. Conditions for eligibility for patients with resected Stage III breast cancer (Cohort B) Patients must have undergone either a total mastectomy or a lumpectomy. Patients must have completed one of the following procedures for evaluation of pathologic nodal status. Sentinel lymphadenectomy followed by removal of additional non-sentinel lymph nodes, or Axillary lymphadenectomy without SN isolation procedure. The interval between the last surgery (for breast cancer treatment or staging) and study entry must be no more than 84 days. By pathologic evaluation, ipsilateral nodes must be pN2 or pN3. For patients who undergo lumpectomy, the margins of the resected specimen must be histologically free of invasive tumor and DCIS as determined by the local pathologist. If pathologic examination demonstrates tumor at the line of resection, additional operative procedures may be performed to obtain clear margins. If tumor is still present at the resected margin after re-excision(s), the patient must undergo total mastectomy to be eligible. (Patients with margins positive for LCIS are eligible without additional resection.) For patients who undergo mastectomy, margins must be free of gross residual tumor. Patients with microscopic positive margins are eligible. Conditions for patient eligibility (ALL patients) The patient must have consented to participate and must have signed and dated an IRB-approved consent form that conforms to federal and institutional guidelines. Patients must be female. The patient must be greater than or equal to 18 years old. The patient's ECOG performance status must be 0 or 1. The tumor must be invasive adenocarcinoma of the breast on histologic examination. The breast cancer must be determined to be HER2-positive prior to study entry. Assays performed using FISH require gene amplification. Assays using IHC require a strongly positive (3+) staining score. At the time of study entry, blood counts must meet the following criteria: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) must be greater than/equal to 1200/mm3. Platelet count must be greater than/equal to 100,000/mm3. Hemoglobin must be greater than/equal to 10 g/dL. The following criteria for evidence of adequate hepatic function must be met: total bilirubin must be less than/equal to ULN for the lab unless the patient has a grade 1 bilirubin elevation (greater than ULN to 1.5 x ULN) due to Gilbert's disease or similar syndrome involving slow conjugation of bilirubin; and alkaline phosphatase must be less than 2.5 x ULN for the lab; and AST must be less than/equal to 1.5 x ULN for the lab. Alkaline phosphatase and AST may not both be greater than the ULN. For example, if the alkaline phosphatase is greater than the ULN but less than/equal to 2.5 x ULN, then the AST must be less than/equal to the ULN. If the AST is greater than the ULN but less than/equal to 1.5 x ULN, then the alkaline phosphatase must be less than/equal to ULN. Patients with AST or alkaline phosphatase greater than ULN are eligible for inclusion in the study if liver imaging (CT, MRI, or PET scan) does not demonstrate metastatic disease, and has adequate hepatic function. Patients with either skeletal pain or alkaline phosphatase that is greater than ULN but less than/equal to 2.5 x ULN are eligible for inclusion in the study if a bone scan or PET scan does not demonstrate metastatic disease. Patients with suspicious findings on bone scan or PET scan are eligible if suspicious findings are confirmed as benign by x-ray, MRI, or biopsy. Serum creatinine less than/equal to ULN for the lab. Urine protein/creatinine (UPC) ratio must be less than 1.0. All patients must have their LVEF assessed by 2-D echocardiogram within 3 months prior to study entry. (MUGA scan may be substituted for 2-D echocardiogram based on institutional preferences.) The LVEF must be greater than/equal to 55% regardless of the institution's LLN. Note: Since the pre-entry LVEF serves as the baseline for comparing subsequent LVEF assessments to determine if trastuzumab and bevacizumab therapy can be administered, it is critical that this baseline study be an accurate assessment of the patient's LVEF. If the baseline LVEF is greater than 65%, the investigator is encouraged to have the accuracy of the initial LVEF result confirmed and to consider repeating the study if the accuracy is uncertain. Exclusion Criteria: Conditions for patient ineligibility (Cohort A) FNA alone to diagnose the primary tumor. Surgical axillary staging procedure prior to study entry. (Procedures that are permitted include: 1) FNA or core biopsy of an axillary node for any patient, and 2) although not recommended, a pre-neoadjuvant therapy SN biopsy for patients with clinically negative axillary nodes. Condition for patient ineligibility (Cohort B) Breast reconstruction using tissue expanders or implants at the time of mastectomy. Conditions for patient ineligibility (ALL patients) Definitive clinical or radiologic evidence of metastatic disease. Synchronous bilateral invasive breast cancer. History of ipsilateral or contralateral invasive breast cancer regardless of treatment or ipsilateral DCIS treated with RT. History of non-breast malignancies within the 5 years prior to study entry. Patients with the following cancers are eligible if diagnosed and treated within the previous 5 years: carcinoma in situ of the cervix, carcinoma in situ of the colon, melanoma in situ, and basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. Prior therapy with anthracyclines, taxanes, trastuzumab, or bevacizumab for any malignancy. Treatment including RT, chemotherapy, and/or targeted therapy, administered for the currently diagnosed breast cancer prior to study entry. Continued therapy with any hormonal agent such as raloxifene, tamoxifen, or other SERM. (Patients are eligible if these medications are discontinued prior to study entry.) Any sex hormonal therapy, e.g., birth control pills, ovarian hormone replacement therapy, etc. These patients are eligible if this therapy is discontinued prior to study entry. (Women of reproductive potential must agree to use an effective non-hormonal method of contraception during study therapy and for at least 6 months after completion of targeted therapy.) Cardiac disease that would preclude the use of the drugs included in the FB-5 treatment regimen. This includes but is not confined to: Active cardiac disease: angina pectoris that requires the use of anti-anginal medication; ventricular arrhythmias except for benign premature ventricular contractions controlled by medication; supraventricular and nodal arrhythmias requiring a pacemaker or not controlled with medication; conduction abnormality requiring a pacemaker; and clinically significant valvular disease. History of cardiac disease: myocardial infarction documented by elevated cardiac enzymes or persistent regional wall abnormalities on assessment of LV function; documented CHF; or documented cardiomyopathy. Uncontrolled hypertension defined as systolic BP greater than 150 mmHg or diastolic BP greater han 90 mmHg, with or without anti-hypertensive medication. Patients with initial BP elevations are eligible if initiation or adjustment of BP medication lowers pressure to meet entry criteria. History of hypertensive crisis or hypertensive encephalopathy. History of TIA or CVA. History of other arterial thrombotic event within 12 months before study entry. Symptomatic peripheral vascular disease. Any significant bleeding within 6 months before study entry, exclusive of menorrhagia in premenopausal women. Serious or non-healing wound, skin ulcers, or bone fracture. Gastroduodenal ulcer(s) determined by endoscopy to be active. History of GI perforation, abdominal fistulae, or intra-abdominal abscess.

The following criteria for evidence of adequate hepatic function must be met: total bilirubin must be less than/equal to ULN for the lab unless the patient has a grade 1 bilirubin elevation (greater than ULN to 1.5 x ULN) due to Gilbert's disease or similar syndrome involving slow conjugation of bilirubin; and alkaline phosphatase must be less than 2.5 x ULN for the lab; and AST must be less than/equal to 1.5 x ULN for the lab. Alkaline phosphatase and AST may not both be greater than the ULN. For example, if the alkaline phosphatase is greater than the ULN but less than/equal to 2.5 x ULN, then the AST must be less than/equal to the ULN. If the AST is greater than the ULN but less than/equal to 1.5 x ULN, then the alkaline phosphatase must be less than/equal to ULN. Patients with AST or alkaline phosphatase greater than ULN are eligible for inclusion in the study if liver imaging (CT, MRI, or PET scan) does not demonstrate metastatic disease, and has adequate hepatic function. Patients with either skeletal pain or alkaline phosphatase that is greater than ULN but less than/equal to 2.5 x ULN are eligible for inclusion in the study if a bone scan or PET scan does not demonstrate metastatic disease. Patients with suspicious findings on bone scan or PET scan are eligible if suspicious findings are confirmed as benign by x-ray, MRI, or biopsy. Serum creatinine less than/equal to ULN for the lab. Urine protein/creatinine (UPC) ratio must be less than 1.0. All patients must have their LVEF assessed by 2-D echocardiogram within 3 months prior to study entry. (MUGA scan may be substituted for 2-D echocardiogram based on institutional preferences.) The LVEF must be greater than/equal to 55% regardless of the institution's LLN. Note: Since the pre-entry LVEF serves as the baseline for comparing subsequent LVEF assessments to determine if trastuzumab and bevacizumab therapy can be administered, it is critical that this baseline study be an accurate assessment of the patient's LVEF. If the baseline LVEF is greater than 65%, the investigator is encouraged to have the accuracy of the initial LVEF result confirmed and to consider repeating the study if the accuracy is uncertain. Exclusion Criteria: Conditions for patient ineligibility (Cohort A) FNA alone to diagnose the primary tumor. Surgical axillary staging procedure prior to study entry. (Procedures that are permitted include: 1) FNA or core biopsy of an axillary node for any patient, and 2) although not recommended, a pre-neoadjuvant therapy SN biopsy for patients with clinically negative axillary nodes. Condition for patient ineligibility (Cohort B) Breast reconstruction using tissue expanders or implants at the time of mastectomy. Conditions for patient ineligibility (ALL patients) Definitive clinical or radiologic evidence of metastatic disease. Synchronous bilateral invasive breast cancer. History of ipsilateral or contralateral invasive breast cancer regardless of treatment or ipsilateral DCIS treated with RT. History of non-breast malignancies within the 5 years prior to study entry. Patients with the following cancers are eligible if diagnosed and treated within the previous 5 years: carcinoma in situ of the cervix, carcinoma in situ of the colon, melanoma in situ, and basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. Prior therapy with anthracyclines, taxanes, trastuzumab, or bevacizumab for any malignancy. Treatment including RT, chemotherapy, and/or targeted therapy, administered for the currently diagnosed breast cancer prior to study entry. Continued therapy with any hormonal agent such as raloxifene, tamoxifen, or other SERM. (Patients are eligible if these medications are discontinued prior to study entry.) Any sex hormonal therapy, e.g., birth control pills, ovarian hormone replacement therapy, etc. These patients are eligible if this therapy is discontinued prior to study entry. (Women of reproductive potential must agree to use an effective non-hormonal method of contraception during study therapy and for at least 6 months after completion of targeted therapy.) Cardiac disease that would preclude the use of the drugs included in the FB-5 treatment regimen. This includes but is not confined to: Active cardiac disease: angina pectoris that requires the use of anti-anginal medication; ventricular arrhythmias except for benign premature ventricular contractions controlled by medication; supraventricular and nodal arrhythmias requiring a pacemaker or not controlled with medication; conduction abnormality requiring a pacemaker; and clinically significant valvular disease. History of cardiac disease: myocardial infarction documented by elevated cardiac enzymes or persistent regional wall abnormalities on assessment of LV function; documented CHF; or documented cardiomyopathy. Uncontrolled hypertension defined as systolic BP greater than 150 mmHg or diastolic BP greater han 90 mmHg, with or without anti-hypertensive medication. Patients with initial BP elevations are eligible if initiation or adjustment of BP medication lowers pressure to meet entry criteria. History of hypertensive crisis or hypertensive encephalopathy. History of TIA or CVA. History of other arterial thrombotic event within 12 months before study entry. Symptomatic peripheral vascular disease. Any significant bleeding within 6 months before study entry, exclusive of menorrhagia in premenopausal women. Serious or non-healing wound, skin ulcers, or bone fracture. Gastroduodenal ulcer(s) determined by endoscopy to be active. History of GI perforation, abdominal fistulae, or intra-abdominal abscess. Anticipation of need for major surgical procedures (other than the breast surgery required for patients in Cohort A) during study therapy and for at least 3 months following completion of bevacizumab. Known bleeding diathesis, coagulopathy, or requirement for therapeutic doses of coumadin. Other nonmalignant systemic disease that would preclude the patient from receiving study treatment or would prevent required follow-up. Sensory/motor neuropathy greater than/equal to grade 2, as defined by the NCI's CTCAE v3.0. Conditions that would prohibit administration of corticosteroids. History of hypersensitivity reaction to drugs formulated with polysorbate 80. Pregnancy or lactation at the time of study entry. (Note: Pregnancy testing should be performed according to institutional standards for women of child-bearing potential.) Use of any investigational agent within 4 weeks prior to enrollment in the study. Psychiatric or addictive disorders or other conditions that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude the patient from meeting the study requirements.\nStatement: Anna is a 57 year old female with an ECOG of 0, diagnosed with an invasive adenocarcinoma of the breast, IHC results were 1+.

The patient must have a life expectancy of at least 10 years and a Zubrod performance status of 0 or 1. (Comorbid conditions but not the diagnosis of breast cancer should be taken into consideration when determining life expectancy.) The interval between the last surgery for breast cancer staging or treatment and randomization must be no more than 84 days. The tumor must be invasive carcinoma of the breast on histologic examination. All of the following staging criteria must be met: By clinical and pathologic evaluation, primary tumor must be T1-3; By clinical evaluation, ipsilateral nodes must be cN0, cN1, or cN2a; By pathologic evaluation, ipsilateral nodes must be pN1 (pN1mi, pN1a, pN1b, pN1c), pN2a, pN3a, or pN3b (only if due to microscopic involvement of internal mammary node detected by sentinel lymph node dissection and with more than 3 positive axillary lymph nodes). Patients must have an estrogen receptor (ER) analysis performed on the primary tumor prior to randomization. If ER analysis is negative, then progesterone receptor (PgR) analysis must be performed. If ER analysis is positive, PgR analysis is desired, but not mandatory. (\"Marginal\" or \"borderline\" results [i.e., those not definitely negative] will be considered positive regardless of the methodology used.) Patients must have had either a lumpectomy or a total mastectomy. Patients must have completed one of the following procedures for evaluation of pathologic nodal status. Sentinel lymphadenectomy followed by removal of additional non-sentinel lymph nodes (This approach is strongly recommended.) Sentinel lymphadenectomy alone if one of the following criteria is met: Pathologic nodal staging based on sentinel lymphadenectomy is pN1mi or pN1b Surgeon elects not to remove additional non-sentinel nodes (This approach is strongly discouraged, but will not preclude participation in B-38.) Axillary lymphadenectomy without sentinel node isolation procedure. Patients must have no clinical or radiologic evidence of metastatic disease. Patients with either skeletal pain or alkaline phosphatase that is greater than ULN but less than or equal to 2.5 x ULN are eligible for inclusion in the study if bone scans fail to demonstrate metastatic disease. Suspicious findings on bone scan must be confirmed as benign by x-ray, MRI, or biopsy. Patients with aspartate transaminase (AST) or alkaline phosphatase greater than ULN are eligible for inclusion in the study if liver imaging fails to demonstrate metastatic disease and the following requirements are met at the time of randomization. Postoperative absolute granulocyte count (AGC) must be greater than or equal to 1200/mm3. Postoperative platelet count must be greater than or equal to 100,000/mm3. The following criteria for postoperative evidence of adequate hepatic function must be met: total bilirubin must be less than or equal to ULN for the lab unless the patient has a grade 1 bilirubin elevation (greater than ULN to 1.5 x ULN) due to Gilbert's disease or similar syndrome due to slow conjugation of bilirubin; and alkaline phosphatase must be less than or equal to 2.5 x ULN for the lab; and the AST must be less than or equal to 1.5 x ULN for the lab; and alkaline phosphatase and AST cannot both be greater than ULN. Postoperative serum creatinine must be less than or equal to ULN. At the time of randomization, the patient must have had the following: history and physical exam, EKG, and imaging of the chest within the past 3 months and bilateral mammogram within the past 6 months. Within 3 months prior to entry, the patient must have a baseline left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), measured by Multiple Gated Acquisition (MUGA) scan or echocardiogram, greater than or equal to lower limit of normal (LLN) for the facility performing the procedure and no evidence of regional wall abnormalities. Patients with a history of non-breast malignancies are eligible if they have been disease-free for 5 or more years prior to randomization and are deemed by their physician to be at low risk for recurrence. Patients with the following cancers are eligible if diagnosed and treated within the past 5 years: carcinoma in situ of the cervix, carcinoma in situ of the colon, melanoma in situ, and basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. Special conditions for eligibility of lumpectomy patients: radiation therapy and surgery. Patients treated by lumpectomy must meet all the eligibility criteria in addition to the following: Generally, lumpectomy should be reserved for tumors less than 5 cm. However, at the investigator's discretion, patients treated with lumpectomy for tumors greater than or equal to 5 cm are eligible if eligibility criteria for lumpectomy are met. The margins of the resected specimen must be histologically free of invasive tumor and DCIS as determined by the local pathologist. In patients for whom pathologic examination demonstrates tumor present at the line of resection, additional operative procedures may be performed to obtain clear margins. This is permissible even if axillary evaluation has been completed. Patients in whom tumor is still present at the resected margin after re-excision(s) must undergo total mastectomy to be eligible. (Patients with margins positive for lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) are eligible without additional resection.) Irradiation of regional lymph nodes is optional, but plans for radiation therapy must be declared by the investigator prior to randomization for stratification purposes. Special conditions for eligibility of mastectomy patients: radiation therapy o Postmastectomy chest wall and/or regional nodal irradiation is optional. Plans for radiation in mastectomy patients must be declared by the investigator prior to randomization for stratification purposes. Ineligibility Criteria Male patients are not eligible for this study. Women with one or more of the following conditions or prior therapies are also ineligible for this study: Tumor that has been determined to be human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive by immunohistochemistry (3+) or by fluorescent in situ hybridization (positive for gene amplification). Contralateral breast cancer (invasive or DCIS) or a mass or mammographic abnormality in the opposite breast suspicious for malignancy unless there is biopsy proof that the mass is not malignant. Primary tumor staged as T4 for any reason. Clinical nodal stages including cN2b and cN3 or pathologic nodal stages including pN0(i+), pN2b, pN3b with clinically apparent internal mammary nodes, or pN3c. Suspicious nodes in the contralateral axilla or suspicious supraclavicular nodes. Patients with these conditions are considered ineligible unless there is biopsy evidence that these are not involved with tumor. Prior history of breast cancer, including DCIS (patients with a history of LCIS are eligible). Treatment, including radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and/or hormonal therapy administered for the currently diagnosed breast cancer prior to randomization. One exception is hormonal therapy, which may have been given for up to a total of 28 days anytime after diagnosis and before study entry. In such a case, hormonal therapy must stop at or before randomization and be re-started, if indicated, following chemotherapy. A second exception is radiation therapy for patients enrolled in NSABP B-39 and assigned to partial breast irradiation (Group 2). These patients may have received RT prior to B-38 study entry. Prior therapy with anthracyclines or taxanes for any malignancy. Any sex hormonal therapy, e.g., birth control pills, ovarian hormonal replacement therapy, etc. (These patients are eligible if this therapy is discontinued prior to randomization.) Therapy with any hormonal agents such as raloxifene (Evista\u00ae), tamoxifen, or other selective estrogen-receptor modulators (SERMs), either for osteoporosis or breast cancer prevention. (Patients are eligible only if these medications are discontinued prior to randomization. Cardiac disease that would preclude the use of anthracyclines. This includes: history of myocardial infarction documented by elevated cardiac enzymes or regional wall abnormalities on assessment of left ventricular (LV) function; angina pectoris that requires the use of anti-anginal medication; any history of documented congestive heart failure; serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication; severe conduction abnormality; valvular disease with documented cardiac function compromise; and uncontrolled hypertension defined as blood pressure greater than 160/100 on antihypertensive therapy. Conditions that would prohibit administration of corticosteroids. Sensory/motor neuropathy greater than or equal to grade 2, as defined by the NCI's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 3.0. Non-malignant systemic disease (cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, etc.) that would preclude a patient from receiving any of the treatment options or would prevent prolonged follow-up. History of hepatitis B or C. Pregnancy or lactation at the time of proposed randomization. Women of reproductive potential must agree to use an effective non-hormonal method of contraception. Concurrent treatment with other investigational agents for the treatment of breast cancer. Psychiatric or addictive disorders or other conditions that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude the patient from meeting the study requirements. Special conditions for ineligibility of lumpectomy patients: radiation therapy and surgery For patients treated by lumpectomy, whole breast irradiation is required. The following patients will be ineligible: Patients with diffuse tumors (as demonstrated on mammography) treated with lumpectomy. (These patients are eligible if they undergo mastectomy.) Patients treated with lumpectomy in whom there is another clinically dominant mass or mammographically suspicious abnormality within the ipsilateral breast remnant. Such a mass must be biopsied and demonstrated to be histologically benign prior to randomization or, if malignant, must be surgically removed with clear margins.
